# JavaScript Engineer Questions

## Code review 

One part of the interview is a discussion of a very short code review. We ask you to spend a few minutes to review these files and familiarize yourself with the code. 
    
You don't have to share anything with us beforehand! Just come prepared to have a conversation about the following during the interview. 
- quality
- improvements
- code smells 

## Situational Questions 
- What's your testing philosophy? If you had free rein to establish testing standards for a project you're working on, what would you choose to do?
- Give an example of a time you inherited a legacy code base.
        - What was one of the larger challenges that you faced?
        - How did you solve it?
        - What did you want to improve for the next person?
- Can you tell us about a recent project or code base where you worked with an API?
- Can you tell me about a time you ensured a website or web application was accessible and user-friendly?
- How do you manage state in your applications?
- What tools or techniques do you use to measure and optimize page-load performance in a JavaScript application?
- Help Scout is going to be launching a feature in which users can attach large files of varying formats. At a high level describe how you'd approach the problem, what are the potentially difficult areas of this project? How do you make it fault tolerant and performant?

## Other (5 minutes) 
- What experience do you have in other areas of development? E.g. backend, mobile.

## Professional Development & Workflows
