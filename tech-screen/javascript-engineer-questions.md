# JavaScript Engineer Questions

## Code review - 15 minutes

One part of the interview is a discussion of a very short code review. We ask you to spend a few minutes to review these files and familiarize yourself with the code. 
    
You don't have to share anything with us beforehand! Just come prepared to have a conversation about the following during the interview. 
- quality
- improvements
- code smells 

##  Core Concepts (10 minutes) - interviewer I
- JS knowledge
    - What are your favorite new or future features of JavaScript?
    - Describe the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance.
    - Have you work with css-in-js, what advantages do you see over plain CSS? disadvantages?
- General programming knowledge
    - Describe your understanding of asynchronous and synchronous programming. 
    - Describe the difference between mutable and immutable data structures. 
    - Can you describe one or more ways to handle async tasks in JS? Which one do you prefer and why?
    - For handling in JS should talk about: callbacks / Promises / async-await / perhaps RxJS
- App development knowledge
    - Describe the difference between mutable and immutable data structures. 
    - Can you describe an example of a situation where having an immutable structure helped solve something or would have helped
    
- Fundamentals. OO, Database, MVC, Service Layers
    - What's your experience with object-oriented programming? 
    - In terms of classical OOP, explain a class and an object and their differences.
    - Explain composition versus inheritance.
    - Have you had the chance to incorporate any design patterns into your work? I
    - Is there a design pattern that you reach for often or you find particularly useful? Why?
            
- Databases: 
    - Do you have any experience with databases? 
        - What are primary and foreign keys?
        - Relational or NoSQL? 
            - What is the difference between a document-based database and a relational database?
            - What are the tradeoffs between the two (i.e. when would you prefer to use one over the other)? 
    - Have you ever encountered denormalization? 
        - Did denormalization make sense in that scenario?
## Situational Questions (20 minutes)
- What's your testing philosophy? If you had free rein to establish testing standards for a project you're working on, what would you choose to do?
- Give an example of a time you inherited a legacy code base.
        - What was one of the larger challenges that you faced?
        - How did you solve it?
        - What did you want to improve for the next person?
- Can you tell us about a recent project or code base where you worked with an API?
- Can you tell me about a time you ensured a website or web application was accessible and user-friendly?
- How do you manage state in your applications?
- What tools or techniques do you use to measure and optimize page-load performance in a JavaScript application?
- Help Scout is going to be launching a feature in which users can attach large files of varying formats. At a high level describe how you'd approach the problem, what are the potentially difficult areas of this project? How do you make it fault tolerant and performant?

## Other (5 minutes) 
- What experience do you have in other areas of development? E.g. backend, mobile.

## Professional Development & Workflows
- Describe your preferred day to day workflow
- How have you done code reviews in the past, what did you like and what would you want to change?
