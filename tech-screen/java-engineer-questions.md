# Java Engineer Questions

## Code review 

One part of the interview is a discussion of a very short code review. You will be sent an archive with small batch of Java files. We ask you to spend a few minutes to review these files and familiarize yourself with the code. 
    
You don't have to share anything with us beforehand! Just come prepared to have a conversation about the following during the interview. 
- quality
- improvements
- code smells 

## Behavioral Questions
